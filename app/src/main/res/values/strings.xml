    <string name="bubbleDesc">Think of this sorting method as a line of bubbles.
        Each number is its own bubble, and the density of the bubble is the number.
        This method goes through the list, comparing two adjacent numbers, or the difference between their densities.
        If the selected number is larger than the next number, the numbers switch positions in the line.
        The selected number will continue to move down the line until the next number is of equal or larger value, or it has reached the end of the list.
        Once the method has reached the end of the list, it restarts at the beginning.
        This continuation ensures the smaller numbers are at one end, and the larger numbers at the other.
    </string>
    <string name="selectionDesc">This sorting method looks through the entire list, looking for the smallest number.
        When the method reaches the end of the list, the method switches the locations of the smallest number and the number at the beginning of the list.
        The process continues for the rest of the list, shortening its search span, since the computer knows the beginning of the list has been sorted.
    </string>
    <string name="insertionDesc">In this sorting method, the selected number is \'inserted\' into the proper location in the sorted section of the list (if any).
        The selected number looks through the numbers before it,
        until it finds a location where the selected number is larger than the number before and smaller the number after.
        The process then moves the numbers to the right of the position over one, so the selected number can \'insert\' itself into the sorted section.
